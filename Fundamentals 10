What do the colors say about their product?
How does it influence their design?

[Penny Arcade](https://www.penny-arcade.com/)

Features a complimentary/split-complementary color scheme utilizing dark blue as the primary color, along with a light blue and bright orange as accent colors.  The site features commentary and comics about video games, so I believe these colors were chosen for their psychological associations; blue is frequently associated with technology, while orange is frequently associated with activity and levity.  Their color choice is effective, and serves the design of the site well.  The orange is used to highlight links to the newest page content, with the light blue highlighting links to regularly updated content (such as their comics) and the dark blue as a backdrop against sharp white text.  It's easy on the eyes, appropriately calls attention to new content, but doesn't distract from the rest of the page so much that you don't read the body text of their posts.
